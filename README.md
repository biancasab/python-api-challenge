# python-api-challenge

This is my submission for the Module 6 challenge of my Data Analytics Bootcamp.
There are two python files (WeatherPy and VacationPy). 

In the VacationPy file, my ideal weather conditions are a max temperature lower than 25 degrees but higher than 15, wind speed of less than 5m/s, and cloudiness less than 5. 

I used the activities from class sessions as a reference for my coding. I also consulted with ChatGPT when I encounter errors on my code.
